Intro :

Package Management :
                   - Package management is a method of installing, updating, removing, and keeping track of software updates from specific repositories (repos) in the Linux system. Linux distros often use different package management tools. 
            Red Hat-based distros use RPM (RPM Package Manager) and YUM/DNF (Yellow Dog Updater, Modified/Dandified YUM).
                  - A Linux software package is nothing but a compressed archive of files,consisting of a particular product information,program files,icons,libraries etc. which enables the functioning of that software package.
            Red hat Linux,Fedora & all other red hat based distributions uses RPM as their main software installation package tool.
                   - YUM is the primary package management tool for installing, updating, removing, and managing software packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. YUM performs dependency resolution when installing, updating, and removing software packages.
            YUM can manage packages from installed repositories in the system or from .rpm packages. The main configuration file for YUM is at /etc/yum.conf, and all the repos are at /etc/yum.repos.d.

YUM Package Manager :
                     YUM is the tool provided for package management in CentOS. We have briefly touched this topic in previous chapters. In this chapter, we will be working from a clean CentOS install. We will first completely update our installation and then install an application.
            YUM has brought software installation and management in Linux a long way. YUM "automagically” checks for out-of-date dependencies, in addition to out-of-date packages. This has really taken a load off the CentOS administrator compared to the old days of compiling every application from source-code.

Commands for Package Management :

- To view the package details :- yum info PACKAGENAME
- Install a package :- yum install PACKAGENAME
- Update all packages :- yum update
- Remove a package :- yum remove PACKAGENAME
- To view transaction history :- yum remove PACKAGENAME
- To reverse a transaction :- yum history undo INDEXNUMBER


RPM Package Manager (RPM) :
                           YUM and DNF are simply front-ends to a lower-level tool called RPM, similar to apt-get’s relationship with dpkg. 
                           You will likely not need to interact with RPM very often, but there are a few commands that you may find useful. 

Basic RPM commands :

- To install an rpm from the file :- rpm -ivh filename.rpm
- To list the name of all packages currently installed :- rpm --query --all or rpm -qa - 
- To generates a list of files installed by a given package :- rpm -ql
- To remove the given package :- rpm --erase package-name(s) or rpm -e


Yum Repository :
                 A YUM repository is a repository meant for holding and managing RPM Packages. It supports clients such as yum and zypper used by popular Unix systems such as RHEL and CentOS for managing binary packages. 
Artifactory is a fully-fledged RPM and YUM repository manager allowing you to integrate YUM packaging management into your organization and to your CI/CD software development flows.
It enables: -> RPM metadata calculation for RPMs hosted in Artifactory local repositories.
            -> Provisioning RPMs directly from Artifactory to YUM clients.
            -> Enables high concurrency performance for the software development industry   
            -> Detailed RPM metadata views from Artifactory's web UI.
            -> Providing GPG signatures that can be used by the YUM client to authenticate RPM metadata.
Basics :

- File must exist in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory
- File must have an extension .repo
- If GPG check is enabled then GPG key must be mentioned
