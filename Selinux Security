SELinux, or Security-Enhanced Linux, is a part of the Linux security kernel that acts as a protective agent on servers. In the Linux kernel, SELinux relies on mandatory access controls (MAC)
that restrict users to rules and policies set by the system administrator. MAC is a higher level of access control than the standard discretionary access control (DAC), and prevents security breaches in the system by only processing necessary files that the administrator pre-approves.

SELinux modes

There are three modes of SELinux: Enforcing, Permissive and Disabled.

1)Enforcing mode is the default mode at installation of SELinux. It will enforce the policies on the system, deny access and log actions.
2)Permissive mode is the most commonly used mode for troubleshooting SELinux. In this mode, SELinux enables but does not enforce security policies. Also, this means that actions will result in a warning and log for the system administrator.
3)Disabled mode means that SELinux is turned off and the security policies do not protect the server.

Commands- 
1. getinforce - to enforce the privacy policy
2. sestatus - to get information about the current status of SELinux 

To ENABLE/DISABLE SELinux follow the following steps :
   1. vi /etc/se
   2. vi /etc/selinux/config  -  After this it will enable you to change the mode of SELinux.
